    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "- In the previous years, courses related to IT and Technology on Udemy have generated significant profits. This could be attributed to the growing Information Technology industry, the demand for technical skills in the job market, and a high level of interest from learners.\n",
    "- The data suggests a substantial decline in profits courses on Udemy in 2021 and 2022. Several factors may contribute to this, including increased competition, the emergence of alternative online education platforms, or even shifts in learners' preferences.\n",
    "- External factors, such as economic conditions or global events, can impact the demand for specific skills. Economic downturns or shifts in the job market may influence the decision-making of individuals seeking courses, leading to changes in enrollment and, consequently, profitability."

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "- Through the two charts showing the top 5 categories with the most courses and the top 5 categories with the most subscribers, it can be seen that categories `Development` and `Business` are always in the top 5 categories. No matter what the trend is, these two categories still occupy an important position.\n",
    "- From 2018 to 2020, it can be seen that this is the time when the categories have the most subscribers. Maybe because this is the time when the whole world has to fight the Covid-19, so people limit activities at school and an online learning place like Udemy is chosen by everyone to continue their studies.\n",
    "- Maybe `Development` doesn't have too many courses, specifically from 2020, the number of courses in `Development` is only in the top 3. But the number of subscribers in `Development` is always in the top 1 and the difference is very large compared to the remaining categories.\n",
    "- Besides, although `IT & Software` has only been developed since 2015, the number of subscribers for this category is top 2 only to `Development` until now.\n",
    "- It seems that the world is following the trend of technology, so `Development` and `IT & Software` courses are of great interest to everyone."
